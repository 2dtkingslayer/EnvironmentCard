#### By Truong Duc Dang (2DT Official)

## How to Run?
- Click in to the WWDC2022 folder.
- Clone all the folders and file here.
- Open the source code on Xcode then run.
- The app is interactive but in my opinion, the best interface is when we use iPhone 11.

## App Description
My flashcard app gives some basic information and knowledge about protecting environment. Environment is a lifetime topic; however, it is always ignored and damaged by humans despite warnings in education and even on social media. Therefore, I decided to build this app to educate users about conserving the nature.

## Properties: 
- [x] User can see the app icon, the splash screen
- [x] Answer options in multiple choice are randomized
- [x] User can re-open the app and see previously created flashcards


There are two modes (practice and quiz modes)
### "Practice" Mode
- [x] User can see an flip animation when revealing the answer
- [x] User should see a slide animation when going to the next/previous flashcard
- [x] User can browse through multiple flashcards
- [x] User can delete a flashcard or edit an existing flashcard
- [x] New and changed features are saved to disk

### "Quiz" Mode
- [x] User can do a quiz
- [x] Each question attempt is limited with only 15 seconds
- [x] User has maximum three wrong attempts anytime doing a quiz
- [x] High score is saved to disk after every quiz
- [x] Celebration cups will drop when user answers all the questions correctly

# Enjoy
